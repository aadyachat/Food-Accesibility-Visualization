    <h1>Visualizing Food Accessibility in Massachusetts</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        The concept of food deserts can be defined as a region where
        residents have limited or virtually no cheap and healthy food
        options and have a multitude of detrimental effects. These
        affected communities lack the means to seek out alternatives that
        are farther away with limited transportation methods or are more
        expensive.
       
        To inform Massachusetts residents of what grocery
        establishments are accessible and suited for their grocery
        priorities, we created our visualization tool in light of the
        prevalence of food deserts in Massachusetts. End users will be
        able to get a visual representation of the geographical location of
        food retailers across the state along with ability to hone in on local
        retailers based on their town. Users will be able to visually
        perceive clustering of food establishments or noticeably empty
        areas. This can aid them in finding new establishments or areas to
        frequent to purchase food. The visualization will also support
        informing the target end user for better understanding their
        options by categorizing them by establishment type. They will be
        able to compare the totals of each establishment type given a
        specific area. To understand the distribution of food options will
        empower Massachusetts residents to better advocated for
        themselves whether they are concerned for their health, budget, or
        ease of access of the food they need.
       
        Users will be able to filter the represented retailers based on
        town location to get a better understanding of their local options.
        Within the set filters, consumers will be able to gauge based on a
        tooltip to gather necessary information to better inform their choice including
        the store address and establishment type.
       
        These tasks are crucial to support as food is daily necessity for every person and
        improving the process of obtaining it can help fight issues like food-related
        health issues, financial struggles, or even food insecurity.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <h3>Data: </h3> 
        The dataset used is a compilation of food retailers in
        Massachusetts that is from the Metropolitan Area Planning
        Council's compilation of food system datasets. The specific
        dataset used is collected by Tufts University. The original dataset
        is found at this url <a href="https://datacommon.mapc.org/browser/datasets/416.
        "> https://datacommon.mapc.org/browser/datasets/416. </a>
        The dataset originally has 9575 items and 16 attributes.
        This dataset includes straightforward data regarding the
        geographical locations of different food retailers along with a
        basic classification of the retailer type. As a result, there are no
        evident biases or ethical issues with this dataset or the collection
        of it.

        During the data exploration process it was discovered that this
        dataset includes attributes that are not necessary for our visual
        encoding. For instance, the state column was the same for each
        entry as each retailer is located in Massachusetts, so the column
        was rendered useless. Additionally, many columns had ids and
        codes that did not have any clear meaning or significance to our
        visual encoding. To clean this dataset, the record type, state, year,
        source, farmers market id, ebt, and coupons can be removed. The
        data in this dataset was nominal so explorations did not depict any
        outliers or other statistical anomalies. Lastly, the dataset had no
        null values which concluded our data exploration and processing.
